It is well known that producing a vaccine for highly mutable viruses, like
influenza or HIV, is a daunting, and yet unsolved, problem. The high mutability
rates of these viruses allows them to elude the classical strategies employed
by the immune system, making the produced antibodies inefficient. 

Yet, in few infected patients it has been observed the formation of antibodies
with a broad spectrum of activity, which are able to recognize different viral
strains.  Unfortunately, these Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies (bNAbs) take a
long time to form naturally, if ever. 

The goal of this research project is to give some insight into the modeling of
the formation of these bNAbs, with the ultimate goal of developing vaccination
strategies able to elicit their formation. In particular, my part of the
project focuses on the *in silico* evaluation of the antibody-antigen binding
affinity, which is a key step for a quantitative modeling of the maturation of
the antibodies.

This project a collaboration between three research groups:
 - Martin Karplus at Harvard University (where I am)
 - Arup Chakraborty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
 - Felice Lightstone at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)

### <a name="SC164"></a> SC164 - Corundum var Ruby

**Size:** 3 x 3 x 1 cm  

Corundum/Ruby with unknown inclusions, unknown locality, size ~3cm.

The ruby
fluoresce red under both 365nm led UV light and 404nm blue laser, but under 365nm led the inclusions
fluoresce a nice bluish white, which is not visible under the 405nm laser.

Following, the fluorescence spectra under different excitation wavelengths. The
first one shows the Cr<sup>3+</sup> strong line.  It should be two lines at
693nm and 694nm, but my spectrometer cannot resolve them. The smaller lines
before and after the main peak are also due to the Cr.  The second spectrum is
a scaled down version of the first, showing also lower wavelengths down to
400nm.  The flat broad peak between 400nm and 500nm could be the unknown bluish
white fluorescent inclusion, but I'm not sure (could be bleeding of the led
light).  The complex Cr peaks at ~700nm are also more visible in the second
image.  Third, fourth and fifth spectra are the fluorescence peaks under blue,
green and red laser. The strong Cr<sup>3+</sup> peak is visible in all of them.
Last one is a comparison of all fluorescence spectra.

### Thorium metal

Thorium in metallic form has a nice silver color, which blackens when exposed
to air due to the formation of a superficial layer of thorium oxide
(ThO<sub>2</sub>).  In the figure, a small sample in a glass vial. It is a
strip 6 mm long, 3 mm wide, but I have no idea of its thickness. Assuming a
thickness of 0.1 mm, the sample would weight about 20 mg.  It should be at
least 98.5-99% pure. Due to the very small mass, its activity is very low. As
of May 2018, the SGS-5 geiger counter measures 7 CPM (background already
subtracted), or 0.04 &mu;Sv/h.

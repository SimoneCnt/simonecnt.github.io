MineralApp is a small and simple application to create a database of your
minerals. You can add your mineral collection, storing any details you are
interested in, helping you (hopefully...) to keep your mineral collection well
organized!

The application is free to use for everyone. If you like it and find it useful,
I would highly appreciate you sending me a postcard (or a mineral!) from your
hometown; here [my current address](/contact).

You can find the source code on <a href="https://github.com/SimoneCnt/MineralApp" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

You can [read the manual](manual/).

For MacOS you can
[download the application in a dmg archive](https://github.com/SimoneCnt/MineralApp/raw/master/MineralApp.dmg).
For Linux you will have to compile it from source.
I can not test it for Windows at the moment, but you should be able to compile it from source.
For more informations on the installation process [see the manual](manual/)
If you have any problem [let me know](/contact).

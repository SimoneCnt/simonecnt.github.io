### <a name="SC313"></a> SC313 - Chalcedony from Milwaukee Co., Wisconsin, USA

**Locality:** Milwaukee Co., Wisconsin, USA ([MINDAT](https://www.mindat.org/loc-26813.html))  
**Size:** 5 x 4 x 4 cm  
**Weight:** 94 g  
**minID:** [N1U-HQ7](https://www.mindat.org/N1U-HQ7)

This was collected in northern Milwaukee county along the beach at night.  The
exact location is not known but it may have been north of the Schlitz Audubon
nature center.  I've been told these chalcedony nodules are fairly common and
have varying degrees of fluorescence, most are a dull yellow tan to a dull
orange in color and some show no fluorescence. The element/mineral that causes
the fluorescence is not known, but it could be carbonate. On the lake Michigan
beaches you can find chalcedony after carbonate pseudomorph of Favosites and
Halysites corals and, though this one is not an obvious former fossil, it does
have some interesting patterns/structure that make it a possibility.

The fluorescent spectrum under 365nm LED shows a broad, composite band centered
at about 570nm. Not sure about the activator... Probably carbonates and organic
compounds.

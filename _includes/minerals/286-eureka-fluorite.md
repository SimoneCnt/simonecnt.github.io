### SC286 - Fluorite from the Eureka Mine, Kentucky, USA

**Locality:** Eureka Mine, Marion, Crittenden Co., Kentucky, USA ([MINDAT](https://www.mindat.org/loc-63261.html))  
**Size:** 11 x 8 x 4 cm  
**Weight:** 400g  

Fluorite crystals with small inclusions of sphalerite. The fluorite has the
typical blue fluorescence, but at the base of most crystals there is nice
yellow/orange fluorescence of the sphalerite. I'm not sure it is sphalerite,
but I think it is the most probable suspect... The yellow fluorescence is quite
weak,but clearly visible. If you know better about this locality [let me know](/contact/).
The field of view in the macro 1 and 2 is about 2 and 1cm, respectively.

### <a name="SC295"></a> SC295 - Willemite from the Franklin Mine, New Jersey, USA

**Locality:**  Franklin Mine, Franklin, Franklin Mining District, Sussex County, New Jersey, USA ([MINDAT](https://www.mindat.org/loc-8541.html))  

Green fluorescent willemite with black franklinite and red zincite.

The fluorescence is extremely intense. It is also "daylight fluorescent": if
outside in a sunny day in the shadow the UV light from the sun is enough to make
the sample more green than under artificial light.

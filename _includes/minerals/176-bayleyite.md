### <a name="SC176"></a> SC176 - Bayleyite from Hideout Mine, Utah, USA

**Locality:** Hideout Mine, Deer Flat, White Canyon, San Juan Co., Utah, USA ([MINDAT](https://www.mindat.org/loc-35984.html))  
**Size:** 5 x 3 x 1 cm  
**Weight:** 4 g  
**minID:** [7J2-KFP](https://www.mindat.org/7J2-KFP)

Bright green fluorescent under all wavelengths. Under short wave UV  it is has
a uniform green/blue color, while under long wave and 405nm laser there is a
green/bluish background and some more yellowish "flowers". I'm not sure which
is the bayleyite, probably it is a mixture of secondary uranium minerals.  

The fluorescence spectrum shows typical UO<sub>2</sub> ions profile. Very similar spectra are
obtained under short wave, long wave, and 405nm laser. 

It is not too much radioactive: I measure 0.36 uS/h of beta+gamma, just 3 times
the background here (but it is very powdery and water soluble (?), so beware!)

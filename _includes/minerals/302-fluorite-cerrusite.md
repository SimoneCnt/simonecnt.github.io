### SC302 - Fluorite cubes with Cerrusite from New Mexico, USA

**Locality:** Blanchard Mine, Bingham, Hansonburg District, Socorro Co., New Mexico, USA ([MINDAT](https://www.mindat.org/loc-3993.html))  
**Size:** 12 x 10 x 7 cm  

White fluorite cubes covered by secondary lead minerals, mostly (?) cerussite.
The cerussite is powdery white, but it covers a translucent mineral which is
not (or weakly so) fluorescent. Biggest fluorite cubes are between 8 and 10 mm
in size.  In the matrix there are some shiny galena cubes, only partially
visible.

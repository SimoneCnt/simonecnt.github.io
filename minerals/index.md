 - [Mineral Collection](collection/)  
   Some of the minerals in my collection. Mostly fluorescent ones, but not only!
 - [Fluorescent Spectra](fluospectra/)  
   I measure the fluorescence spectra of some of my fluorescent minerals. You can find them on this page. Nothing too scientific, just home equipment.
 - [MineralApp](/mineralapp/) ([manual](/mineralapp/manual))  
   An application I wrote to catalog my collection of minerals. The application works on Mac, Windows and Linux and it is freely available for everybody.
 - [Books about fluorescent minerals](fluobooks/)  
   Some books and other references about fluorescent minerals.
 - [From Spectrum to RGB Color - A practical protocol](spectrum2color/)  
   How to compute the color emitted by a fluorescence mineral based on its fluorescence spectrum.

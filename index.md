Hello, my name is Simone.

I'm Italian, currently living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. In the past
I've lived and worked in Italy (in the north, near Milan), and in France (in
Strasbourg).

I'm a chemist and do research in computational chemistry. I've been affiliated
with the Università degli Studi di Milano in Italy, the Institut de Science et
d'Ingénierie Supramoléculaires In Strasbourg, France, and, currently, Harvard
University in Massachusetts, USA. You can [see my curriculum](/cv/) if you want
to...

My research is focused on computer modeling of molecular systems. I've worked
on molecular self-assembly and protein-protein interactions. Currently, I study
how to design vaccines for highly mutable viruses, like HIV and Influenza. You
can read some details about my [research projects](/research/).

As of today, I've published 10 [research papers](/publications/).

I like programming. During my doctorate I programmed mostly in C, shifting now
more to Python...

I collect [minerals](/minerals/), in particular fluorescent ones. I wrote an
[application](/minerals/mineralapp) to catalog my collection. I'm currently
member of the Boston Mineral Club and the Fluorescent Mineral Society.

I like [Juggling](/stuff/juggling/). I find interesting the siteswaps notation.

Feel free to [contact me](/contact) if you have any question!

Here some external links where to find my publications / CV / coding projects /
whatever...

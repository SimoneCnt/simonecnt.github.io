  abstract = {We present an extension of the locally enhanced sampling method. A restraint potential is introduced to drive the many-replica system to the canonical ensemble corresponding to the physical, single-replica system. Convergence properties are demonstrated using a model rugged two-dimensional potential, for which sampling by conventional equilibrium molecular dynamics is inefficient. Restrained locally enhanced sampling (RLES) is found to explore the space of configurations with an efficiency comparable to that of temperature replica exchange. To demonstrate the potential of RLES for realistic applications, the method is used to fold the 12-residue tryptophan zipper miniprotein in explicit solvent. The RLES algorithm can be incorporated into existing LES implementations with minor code modifications.},

  abstract = {HIV is a highly mutable virus for which all attempts to develop a vaccine have been unsuccessful. Nevertheless, few long-infected patients develop antibodies, called broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), that have a high breadth and can neutralize multiple variants of the virus. This suggests that a universal HIV vaccine should be possible. A measure of the efficacy of a HIV vaccine is the neutralization breadth of the antibodies it generates. The breadth is defined as the fraction of viruses in the Seaman panel that are neutralized by the antibody. Experimentally the neutralization ability is measured as the half maximal inhibitory concentration of the antibody (IC50). To avoid such time-consuming experimental measurements, we developed a computational approach to estimate the IC50 and use it to determine the antibody breadth. Given that no direct method exists for calculating IC50 values, we resort to a combination of atomistic modeling and machine learning. For each antibody/virus complex, an all-atoms model is built using the amino acid sequence and a known structure of a related complex. Then a series of descriptors are derived from the atomistic models, and these are used to train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (an Artificial Neural Network) to predict the value of the IC50 (by regression), or if the antibody binds or not to the virus (by classification). The neural networks are trained by use of experimental IC50 values collected in the CATNAP database. The computed breadths obtained by regression and classification are reported and the importance of having some related information in the data set for obtaining accurate predictions is analyzed. This approach is expected to prove useful for the design of HIV bnAbs, where the computation of the potency must be accompanied by a computation of the breadth, and for evaluating the efficiency of potential vaccination schemes developed through modeling and simulation.},

  abstract = {In most technological applications involving liquids or gases in interaction with solids, the first event is the adsorption of molecules onto the solid surface. Here, we focus on the theoretical understanding of the adsorption equilibrium at the solid-gas interface. In the limit of physisorption, we find that the adsorption probability is independent of the initial concentration of monomers, whereas it varies with the available volume to surface ratio, which depends on the experimental setup. This theoretical finding is verified numerically by Molecular Dynamics simulations of five small-molecule gases physisorbing on graphene. The simulations provide quantitative estimates of the adsorption free energy, which are used to benchmark analytical and numerical integrations of the corresponding partition functions. The significance of the theoretical result above is analyzed in the context of molecular self-assembly at surfaces and interfaces. Our interpretation indicates that there exist (at least) two distinct pathways for 2D self-assembly, which involve or not the formation of a 2D disordered intermediate. And, it predicts that the critical concentration for self-assembly may be shifted by varying the aspect ratio of the experimental setup.},

  abstract = {Molecular self-assembly at surfaces and interfaces is a prominent example of self-organization of matter with outstanding technological applications. The ability to predict the equilibrium structure of the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) is of fundamental importance and would boost the development of bottom-up strategies in a number of fields. Here, we present a self-consistent theory for a first-principle interpretation of 2D self-assembly based on modeling and statistical thermodynamics. Our development extends the treatment from finite-size to infinite supramolecular objects and delineates a general framework in which previous approaches can be recovered as particular cases. By proving the existence of a chemical potential per unit cell, we derive an expression for the surface free energy of the SAM (γ), which provides access to the thermodynamic stability of the monolayer in the limit of the ideal gas approximation and the model of energetics in use. Further manipulations of this result provide another expression of γ, which makes the concentration dependence as well as the temperature dependence of 2D self-assembly explicit. In the limit of the approximations above, this second result was used to analyze competitive equilibria at surfaces and rationalize the concentration-and temperature-dependent polymorphism in 2D. Finally, the theory predicts that there exists a critical aggregation concentration (Ccac) of monomers above which 2D self-assembly can be viewed as a "precipitation" in a solubility equilibrium. Numerical analysis of thirteen model SAMs on graphene shows that the value of Ccac sets an absolute scale of 2D self-assembly propensity, which is useful to compare chemically distinct and apparently unrelated self-assembly reactions.},

  abstract = {Understanding the energetics of molecular adsorption at nanostructured carbon materials opens up to outstanding applications in the postgraphene era. The accurate determination of the adsorbate binding affinity remains however a challenge both experimentally and computationally. Here, we report on the determination of the desorption energy of 25 chemically diverse compounds from graphite using computational methods at different levels of theory: empirical force fields (FF), semiempirical quantum mechanics (SQM), and density functional theory (DFT). By comparing the computational predictions with literature temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments we found that the dispersion-corrected semiempirical method PM6-DH+ yields desorption energies in quantitative agreement with the experiments with an average error of 1.25 kcal mol–1. The discovery of a fast and accurate approach to molecular adsorption at surfaces prompted us to search the chemical space of the adsorbate to optimize the binding affinity for graphene. We found that polarizable groups containing sulfur and halogen atoms significantly enhance the interaction strength with the substrate. In particular, we predict that per-chlorination of aliphatic hydrocarbons doubles the desorption energy from graphene in vacuum. The efficiency of the PM6-DH+ calculations, which allows for screening libraries of compounds, guided the design of potentially improved graphene surfactants, which are commercially available.},

Here, we study the effect of edge perchlorination of coronene, a prototypical polyaromatic hydrocarbon, on the binding affinity for the basal planes of graphite. First, by comparing the desorption barrier of hydrogenated vs. perchlorinated coronene measured by temperature programmed desorption we quantify the enhancement of chlorine substitution on the strength of physisorption at the single-molecule level. Then, by a thermodynamic analysis of the corresponding monolayers based on force-field calculations and statistical mechanics we show that perchlorination decreases the free energy of self-assembly not only enthalpically (by enhancing the strength of surface binding) but also entropically (by decreasing the surface concentration). The functional advantage of a chemically modulated 2D self-assembly is demonstrated in the context of the molecule-assisted liquid-phase exfoliation of graphite into graphene.},

  abstract={Achieving the full control over the production as well as processability of high-quality graphene represents a major challenge with potential interest in the field of fabrication of multifunctional devices. The outstanding effort dedicated to tackle this challenge in the last decade revealed that certain organic molecules are capable of leveraging the exfoliation of graphite with different efficiencies. Here, a fundamental understanding on a straightforward supramolecular approach for producing homogenous dispersions of unfunctionalized and non-oxidized graphene nanosheets in four different solvents is attained, namely N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, N,N-dimethylformamide, ortho-dichlorobenzene, and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene. In particular, a comparative study on the liquid-phase exfoliation of graphene in the presence of linear alkanes of different lengths terminated by a carboxylic-acid head group is performed. These molecules act as graphene dispersion-stabilizing agents during the exfoliation process. The efficiency of the exfoliation in terms of concentration of exfoliated graphene is found to be proportional to the length of the employed fatty acid. Importantly, a high percentage of single-layer graphene flakes is revealed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy analyses. A simple yet effective thermodynamic model is developed to interpret the chain-length dependence of the exfoliation yield. This approach relying on the synergistic effect of a ad-hoc solvent and molecules to promote the exfoliation of graphene in liquid media represents a promising and modular strategy towards the rational design of improved dispersion-stabilizing agents.},

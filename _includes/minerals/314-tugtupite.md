### <a name="SC314"></a> SC314 - Tugtupite and Polylithionite from Taseq Slope, Greenland

**Locality:** Taseq Slope, Il√≠maussaq complex, Narsaq, Kujalleq, Greenland ([MINDAT](https://www.mindat.org/loc-1957.html))  
**Size:** 4 x 2 x 2 cm  
**Weight:** 22g  
**minID:** [JUK-GYC](https://www.mindat.org/JUK-GYC)

The "matrix" is mostly tugtupite (tenebrescent pink) and fluorescent red and
orange under shortwave and longwave UV light, respectively. Phosphorescent
white under both shortwave and longwave.  The top left in the first side is
polylithionite, fluorescent yellow/green under shortwave, nothing under
longwave.  Between the polylithionite and the tugtupite there is a little
unknown, fluorescent white/blue(?) mostly under longwave and phosphorescent
whitish.  The second side is again mostly tugtupite. The bottom right corner is
blue/grey, tenebrescent dark red, not much fluorescent under shortwave, and
strong orange under longwave. No phosphorescence. I guess it is blue sodalite?
The crystal on top of the sodalite is not fluorescent. Don't know what it is.
On the back of the sodalite there is something fluorescing white/blue under
shortwave (no photo).  The label says there is tugtupite, chkalovite, albite,
polylithionite, neptunite, pyrochlore, aegirine, sodalite.

### <a name="SC324"></a> SC324 - Sørensenite from Kvanefjeld, Greenland

**Locality:** Kvanefjeld, Ilímaussaq complex, Narsaq, Kujalleq, Greenland ([MINDAT](https://www.mindat.org/loc-30754.html))  
**Size:** 3.5 x 3 x 2 cm  
**Weight:** 15.4 g  
**minID:** [1X3-EU6](https://www.mindat.org/1X3-EU6)

A silicate containing tin and beryllium. Quite rare and only found in
Greenland. Nice grey/white fluorescence under both shortwave and longwave UV
light. Longwave (365nm LED) photo is with a 420nm yellow filter: there is a lot
of blue, which I don't understand if it is reflection of the UV light or
fluorescence. Under longwave part of the sorensenite fluoresces a more yellow/orange
color.

The fluorescence spectra are quite interesting. With a shortwave 275nm LED
excitation there is a broad fluorescence peak at about 440nm with a second peak
at about 405nm (543nm is an artifact). With a longwave 365nm LED the spectrum
is much more complex with multiple peaks at 440nm, 485nm, 505nm, and 580nm.  I
don't know the activator(s): TiO<sub>6</sub> groups are reported in the
literature, and could be the cause of the 440nm broad peak.

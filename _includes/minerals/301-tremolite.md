Tremolite mixed with anthopyllite and/or clino-suenoite. Under long wave UV
light the tremolite fluoresces yellow/orange while the
antophyllite/clino-suenoite fluoresces red/violet. Under shortwave UV light or
405nm laser the red/violet essentially disappears and the whole specimen
fluoresces yellow/orange. Clino-suenoite changed name quite often (tirodite,
manganocummingtonite, ...); see UV Waves v50, n3 (2020).  As far as I know it
is not possible to distinguish the anthopyllite from the clino-suenoite without
elemental analysis. Let's call the red fluorescent mineral(s) "red amphibole"
(as the UV Waves article suggested).

Four spectra were acquired: two for the tremolite and two for the red amphibole,
under 365nm LED and 405nm blue laser. Both tremolite spectra have the same peak
at about about 580nm. This should be due to Mn<sup>2+</sup> substituting
Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The spectrum of the red amphibole under 365nm led shows a peak
at about 650nm (Mn<sup>2+</sup> substituting Mg<sup>2+</sup> ?), with a
shoulder at about 580nm. With the 405nm blue laser the spectrum of the red
amphibole shows two clear peaks: one at 580nm and one at 650nm.

My guess is that the red amphibole spectrum is a mix of the emission of the two
minerals: tremolite emitting at 580nm and the red amphibole at 650nm. The red
amphibole fluoresces weaker under shortwave UV light or 405nm blue laser,
leaving only the tremolite visible. The intensities in the spectra are
normalized and cannot be compared. The sharp peak 535nm is leaking (?) from the
blue laser.

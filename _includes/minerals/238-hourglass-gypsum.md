### #238 - Hourglass Gypsum from Poland

**Locality:** Chodziez Co., Greater Poland Voivodeship, Poland ([MINDAT](https://www.mindat.org/loc-62646.html))  
**Size:** 6.5 x 2 x 1 cm  
**Weight:** 12.4g

Hourglass gypsum/selenite. While clear in white light, it shows a fluorescent
hourglass pattern under UV light. Probably due to selective inclusion of
impurities (hydrocarbons?) along crystallographic faces during crystal growth.
Major diagonal is 6cm long.

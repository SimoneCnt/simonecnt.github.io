### <a name="SC307"></a> SC307 - Petroleum Quartz from Balochistan, Pakistan

**Locality:** Balochistan Region, Pakistan ([MINDAT](https://www.mindat.org/loc-16258.html))  
**Size:** 2 x 1 x 1 cm  
**Weight:** 2.7 g  

A nice little quartz crystal, doubly terminated, with lots of yellow oil
inclusions. Most are small and "solid", one is larger, and contains a moving
bubble (of what?). Under longwave UV light, the solid inclusions fluoresce a
very bright blue, while the larger one has a more yellowish tint (in the photo
it is the white/oversaturated blob).  Unfortunately I couldn't capture the
difference in the photo...

The fluorescence spectrum shows a lot of superimposed peaks in the blue region
(400-500nm), with the maximum of emission in the green region (500-550nm).

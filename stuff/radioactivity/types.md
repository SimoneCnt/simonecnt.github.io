## Alpha
 - He nucleus, 2 protons and 2 neutrons, charged +2
 - Due to charge and mass, it is easy to stop
 - One sheet of paper stops all alpha particles, even the most energetic
 - Energy is quantized. A given isotope produce always alpha with the same energy
 - Stopped by 1 inch of air
 - Danger only when produced within the body, like if you ingested or breath.
 - Quite difficult to detect with GM tubes, as they need an alpha-transparent window, like thin mica

## Beta-
 - Are electrons, charged -1
 - Much ligther than alpha, speed is relativistic
 - Energy is distribution, since beta- is accompained by antineutrino. Energy is shared between the two.
 - Blocked by few mm of aluminum.
 - High energy beta interacts with high atomic weight and produce X rays. Better to stop using low atomic weight, like plastic (plexiglas), wood, water, ...
   Bremsstrahlung radiation. Essentially charged particle is deflected by
nuclei, lose some energy what is emitted as photon. Energy is similar to soft
gamma, but spectrum is continuum.
 - Easy to detect with GM tubes

Penetration r is the max depth the beta electrons can reach in material. After
that, all electrons are adsorbed.

\\[ r = \frac{0.412}{d} E^{1.29} \\]

d is density in g/cm<sup>3</sup> (2.702 for aluminium)

E is the energy of the &beta; rays in MeV



## Gamma
 - It is electromagnetic wave, like visible light, UV or X-rays, microwave, radio, but more energetic
 - Stopped by high atomic weight and high densities (-> so lead is good), but total mass per area in the radiation path is the most important.
 - Pass through anything, adsorbed/shielded by high mass materials
 - Detect with GM tubes easily
 - Adsorpion follow exponential decay with thickness of material:

\\[ N(x) = N\_0 \exp(-\mu x) \\]

\\[ \ln\left(\frac{N(x)}{N\_0}\right) = -\mu x \\]

Half-Value Layer. Layer necessary to half the amount of incident gamma radiation  
 - Concrete: 44.5 mm  
 - Steel: 12.7 mm  
 - Lead: 4.8 mm  
 - Tungsten: 3.3 mm  
 - Uranium: 2.8 mm  

Decrease quadratically with distance. Assuming point emission, 

\\[ I(r) = \frac{I\_0}{4\pi r^2} \\]

so that

\\[ \frac{I(r\_1)}{I(r\_2)} = \frac{r\_2^2}{r\_1^2} \\]

doubling the distance, the intensity decreases by 4.

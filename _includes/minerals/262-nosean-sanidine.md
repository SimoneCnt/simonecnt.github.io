**Locality:**  In den Dellen quarries, Mendig, Mayen-Koblenz District, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany ([MINDAT](https://www.mindat.org/loc-71520.html))  
**Size:** 6 x 5 x 4 cm  

See on [Natures Rainbows](https://www.naturesrainbows.com/single-post/2020/06/25/Nosean-on-Sanidine-from-In-den-Dellen-quarries-Germany)

Under long wave the nosean is bright orange, while the sanidine is bluish
white. Under short wave there is just a dim red fluorescence. Under normal
light the sanidine are white opaque crystals, the nosean "druzy" transparent
tiny crystals on top of the sanidine.

Two fluorescence spectra were measured: the first from a nosean-rich region,
while the second one from a sanidine-only area. The first one shows the typical
vibrionic emission of sulphur (S<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) in sodalite group minerals
(group of peaks around 650nm), plus two other smaller peaks at about 440nm and
500nm. The second spectrum shows only the two smaller peaks. I think these are
from the sanidine, but I do not know much about sanidine fluorescence and its
activator(s).  From the vibrionic emission, the maximum peak is at 643nm.
According to the [ebook written by Ludo Van Goethem and Axel
Emmermann](https://www.naturesrainbows.com/copy-of-sodalite-group-minerals),
this correspond to the emission of nosean (sodalite peak maximum is at 625nm,
nosean at 645nm, haüyne and lazurite at 695nm) The original label said it
contained haüyne, not nosean, so the label was probably wrong.  Also, photos on
Mindat of haüyne from this quarry show light blue crystals, while the druzy in
this sample is transparent.

There is another white translucent mineral mixed with the sanidine (not
fluorescent), but I don't know what it is (as far as I know, this could be the
sanidine, and the fluorescent one an unknown).

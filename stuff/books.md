In my free time, in particular in the evening before sleeping, I like to read
(and collect) books.  Usually I read science-related books, but I also like
fantasy and science fiction. I force myself to read some classic from time to
time...  Goes without saying, I always read books in print format: I already
spend enough time in front of a display during the day...  

I saved on Goodreads the last books I read/bought. You can explore my shelves
following the links below. Feel free to get inspired from the books there if
you want to make me a gift!

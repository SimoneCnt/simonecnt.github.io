  abstract={Here we report for the first time a submolecularly resolved scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) study at the solid/liquid interface of the in situ reversible interconversion between two isomers of a diarylethene photoswitch, that is, open and closed form, self-assembled on a graphite surface. Prolonged irradiation with UV light led to the in situ irreversible formation of another isomer as by-product of the reaction, which due to its preferential physisorption accumulates at the surface. By making use of a simple yet powerful thermodynamic model we provide a quantitative description for the observed surface-induced selection of one isomeric form.},

  abstract = {Understanding the energetics of molecular adsorption at nanostructured carbon materials opens up to outstanding applications in the postgraphene era. The accurate determination of the adsorbate binding affinity remains however a challenge both experimentally and computationally. Here, we report on the determination of the desorption energy of 25 chemically diverse compounds from graphite using computational methods at different levels of theory: empirical force fields (FF), semiempirical quantum mechanics (SQM), and density functional theory (DFT). By comparing the computational predictions with literature temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments we found that the dispersion-corrected semiempirical method PM6-DH+ yields desorption energies in quantitative agreement with the experiments with an average error of 1.25 kcal mol–1. The discovery of a fast and accurate approach to molecular adsorption at surfaces prompted us to search the chemical space of the adsorbate to optimize the binding affinity for graphene. We found that polarizable groups containing sulfur and halogen atoms significantly enhance the interaction strength with the substrate. In particular, we predict that per-chlorination of aliphatic hydrocarbons doubles the desorption energy from graphene in vacuum. The efficiency of the PM6-DH+ calculations, which allows for screening libraries of compounds, guided the design of potentially improved graphene surfactants, which are commercially available.},

  abstract={Achieving the full control over the production as well as processability of high-quality graphene represents a major challenge with potential interest in the field of fabrication of multifunctional devices. The outstanding effort dedicated to tackle this challenge in the last decade revealed that certain organic molecules are capable of leveraging the exfoliation of graphite with different efficiencies. Here, a fundamental understanding on a straightforward supramolecular approach for producing homogenous dispersions of unfunctionalized and non-oxidized graphene nanosheets in four different solvents is attained, namely N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, N,N-dimethylformamide, ortho-dichlorobenzene, and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene. In particular, a comparative study on the liquid-phase exfoliation of graphene in the presence of linear alkanes of different lengths terminated by a carboxylic-acid head group is performed. These molecules act as graphene dispersion-stabilizing agents during the exfoliation process. The efficiency of the exfoliation in terms of concentration of exfoliated graphene is found to be proportional to the length of the employed fatty acid. Importantly, a high percentage of single-layer graphene flakes is revealed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy analyses. A simple yet effective thermodynamic model is developed to interpret the chain-length dependence of the exfoliation yield. This approach relying on the synergistic effect of a ad-hoc solvent and molecules to promote the exfoliation of graphene in liquid media represents a promising and modular strategy towards the rational design of improved dispersion-stabilizing agents.},

Despite the challenges, several studies provided evidences for the development of small molecules modulating protein–protein interactions. Here we consider a typical case of protein–protein interaction stabilization: the complex between FKBP12 and FRB with rapamycin. We have analyzed the stability of the complex and characterized its interactions at the atomic level by performing free energy calculations and computational alanine scanning. It is shown that rapamycin stabilizes the complex by acting as a bridge between the two proteins; and the complex is stable only in the presence of rapamycin.},

  abstract={Osmolyte molecules can be classified in two different groups with respect to their effect on protein stability: osmoprotectants, which stabilize the protein or peptide folded state, and denaturants, which favor the denaturated state. Mechanical unfolding free energy of a model peptide has been obtained from umbrella sampling and weighted histogram analysis method, and the effect of four different osmolytes on the free energy difference between the folded and the denaturated state have been calculated. The observed trend mirrors the expected behavior of the studied osmolytes and unfolding pathways analysis allows an insight in the osmolyte action mechanism.},

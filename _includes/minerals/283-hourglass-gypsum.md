### <a name="SC283"></a> SC283 - Hourglass Gypsum from Poland

**Locality:** Chodziez Co., Greater Poland Voivodeship, Poland ([MINDAT](https://www.mindat.org/loc-62646.html))  
**Size:** 6.5 x 2 x 1 cm  
**Weight:** 12.4g
**minID:** [GFM-DVY](https://www.mindat.org/GFM-DVY)

Hourglass gypsum/selenite. While clear in white light, it shows a fluorescent
hourglass pattern under UV light. Probably due to selective inclusion of
impurities (hydrocarbons?) along crystallographic faces during crystal growth.
Major diagonal is 6cm long.

Fluorescence spectrum under 275nm LED. The blue fluorescence color is due to the broad peak
between 400nm and 500nm. The sharp and intense peak at 339nm (which looks like to be a doublet) 
was a surprise. I don't know what is the cause.

### <a name="SC130"></a> SC130 - Wollastonite from Lewis Co, New York, USA

**Locality:** Gouverneur Talc Company No. 4 Quarry, Diana Township, Lewis Co., New York, USA ([MINDAT](https://www.mindat.org/loc-15933.html))  
**Size:** 5 x 4 x 2 cm  
**Weight:** 48g  
**minID:** [RTY-8V8](https://www.mindat.org/RTY-8V8)

Solid, white wollastonite. Saying that this mineral is fluorescent is probably
a stretch... It glows white/grey under shortwave UV light, with little yellow/orange
bits under longwave UV light, but extremely weakly (not possible to make a photo). What
is more interesting is the phosphorescence/afterglow. Again extremely weak, but
well noticeable and very long lasting (minutes).

# 1 Ball
- 
    pattern: 1
    nballs: 1
    notes: >
        First siteswap to learn! Start with one ball in your R hand, and pass
        it quick to your L hand. Repeat! Only note: the passages must be very 
        quick and horizontal, almost downwards directly to the other hand.
-
    pattern: 20
    nballs: 1
    notes: >
        Even easier than **1**! Just hold one ball in your R hand and do nothing... 
        This pattern is asymmetric, you can start with your ball in your L 
        hand instead!

    pattern: 300
    nballs: 1
    notes: >
        Useful pattern for your first 2 minutes learning juggling. Take one ball 
        on your R hand and pass it to the L hand with a high pass. The pass 
        should pass in front of your eyes. When it land on your L, throw it 
        again to your R and continue. You see the pattern has **00** after the **3**. 
        This means you have time to do something while the ball is in the air. 
        You can try to clap your hands, so to have something like: 
        throw, clap, catch, throw, clap, catch, ... 

# 2 Balls
-
    pattern: 31
    name: 2 balls shower
    nballs: 2
    notes: >
        The 2 balls shower. While not formally juggling, this is the first
        pattern everyone can juggle when trying to learn. The only note, learn
        to make a nice **1** keeping your hands at a good distance and throwing
        the **1** very horizontally, almost downwards. Will help in the future!
-
    pattern: 312
    nballs: 2
    notes: >
        Asymmetric version of the two balls shower, or a two balls shower which
        changes direction continously. The **3** is always the same ball.
        A kind of very simple ping-pong.
-
    pattern: 40
    name: two in one hand
    nballs: 2
    notes: >
        Play two balls in one hand. Practice both L and R. First step to learn 
        four balls!
-
    pattern: 501
    nballs: 2
    notes: >
        Start with both balls in the same hand and throw a high **5** followed
        by a quick **1**, and repeat. You need to be very quick, not super easy!

# 3 Balls
-
    pattern: 3

        The cascade and all its many viariations.

    pattern: 42
    nballs: 3
    prime: y
    notes: >
        Hold one ball in one hand (the **2**), and in the other play the other 
        two in a fountain. You can use this as base for a lot of tricks, like
        moving the ball doing the **2** back and forth, chasing the other balls
        or ''playing'' with them.
-
    pattern: 423
    name: half-shower box
    nballs: 3
    notes: >
        One ball hops back and forth (the **3**), while the other two hops up
        and down one in the R and one in the L. The three balls do not mix.
        Try to make the **4** external.

        A nice pattern. Usefull to improve your **1**. See also **4413** and
        **44133**
-
    pattern: 4413
    nballs: 3
    notes: >
        An asymmetric version of **441**. Just add a three at the end.
-
    pattern: 44133
    nballs: 3
    notes: >
        A slower version of **441**. You can extend it with how many **3** you
        want at the end.

    notes: >
        A tricky pattern. Think of it as a **5** followed by a quick **31**
        swap of the other two balls. Keep the **3** low!

    notes: >
        The rhythm of this pattern is strange... "A complete waste of a 5-balls
        juggler". You can start with two balls in the L and one in the R; throw
        L first. To enter while doing **3** just throw a 4: ...3334{450}233...
-
    pattern: 4440

        Three out of a 4 fountain. Very easy if you can play **4**.

        The baby-juggling. Two balls are doing *55*, and the third *122*.

        3-balls snake (3 out of 5). Take all three balls in one hand and throw
        them to the other. Throw the last before catching the first. Repeat.
        Useful to learn **5** balls. (aka **50505**)

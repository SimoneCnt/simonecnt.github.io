**Locality:** Gouverneur Talc Company No. 4 Quarry, Diana Township, Lewis Co., New York, USA ([MINDAT](https://www.mindat.org/loc-15933.html))  
**Size:** 9 x 5 x 4 cm  
**Weight:** 109g  
**minID:** [2FW-LKL](https://www.mindat.org/2FW-LKL)

Solid, white wollastonite. Saying that this mineral is fluorescent is probably
a stretch... It glows white/grey under shortwave UV light, with little yellow/orange
bits under longwave UV light, but extremely weakly (not possible to make a photo). What
is more interesting is the phosphorescence/afterglow. Again extremely weak, but
well noticeable and very long lasting (minutes).

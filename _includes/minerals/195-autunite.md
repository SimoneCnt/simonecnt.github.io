### #195 - Autunite from Streuberg Quarry, Germany

**Locality:** Streuberg Quarry, Bergen, Vogtlandkreis, Saxony, Germany  ([MINDAT](https://www.mindat.org/loc-1907.html))  
**Size:** 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm  

Very bright green fluorescent autunite.

Comparing my fluorescence spectrum with the one on the fluomin webpage, it
looks like mine is shifted at longer wavelengths. My spectrum matches more the
uranocircite spectrum on fluomin. Streuberg Quarry is the type locality for
uranocircite, so maybe this is not autunite after all..

### <a name="SC166"></a> SC166 - Wollastonite and Diopside from Sterling Mine, NJ

**Locality:** Sterling Mine, Sterling Hill, Ogdensburg, Franklin Mining District, Sussex County, New Jersey, USA ([MINDAT](https://www.mindat.org/loc-3948.html))  
**Size:** 5 x 2.5 x 1 cm  
**Weight:** 20g  
**minID:** [QEW-LH3](https://www.mindat.org/QEW-LH3)

Wollastonite (white) with diopside (dark green) with (probably) minor calcite.
The fluorescence is quite interesting: yellow/orange fluorescence under
shortwave UV light, nothing with long wave, and yellow again with a 405nm blue
laser. With the laser there is a red flash (typical for calcite); not sure if
it is from the wollastonite or some underlying calcite, not really visible
otherwise.

### <a name="SC315"></a> SC315 - Diopside from Lake Valhalla Quarry, New Jersey, USA

**Locality:** Lake Valhalla Quarry, Montville Township, Morris Co., New Jersey, USA  ([MINDAT](https://www.mindat.org/loc-12551.html))  
**Size:** 11 x 7 x 7 cm  
**minID:** [PP4-KPL](https://www.mindat.org/PP4-KPL)

Big chunk of diopside. Nice blue fluorescence under shortwave UV light. Under
longwave UV light the color is more yellowish, and even more with a 405nm
blue laser.  It looks like there is an orange/red flash phosphorescence.

I collected three fluorescence spectra under 275nm LED, 365nm LED and 405nm
blue laser.  The first and second ones show a broad peak at about 435/440 nm.
This should be due to nTiO<sub>6</sub> groups.  It looks like the spectrum
under 365nm led is composite with more hidden peaks at about 470nm, 500nm and
580nm.  The spectrum under 405nm blue laser is very different. The main peak is
now at 580nm, due to Mn<sup>2+</sup> replacing Ca<sup>2+</sup> and there is a
broad peak at about 490nm. I don't know what is the activator for this second
peak. (The sharp peak at 536nm is leaking from the blue laser).

<h3>5 - Surface-induced selection during in situ photoswitching at the solid/liquid interface</h3>
<p><em>Sara Bonacchi, Mohamed El Garah, Artur Ciesielski, Martin Herder, Simone Conti, Marco Cecchini, Stefan Hecht and Paolo Samor√¨</em></p>
<p>Here we report for the first time a submolecularly resolved scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) study at the solid/liquid interface of the in situ reversible interconversion between two isomers of a diarylethene photoswitch, that is, open and closed form, self-assembled on a graphite surface. Prolonged irradiation with UV light led to the in situ irreversible formation of another isomer as by-product of the reaction, which due to its preferential physisorption accumulates at the surface. By making use of a simple yet powerful thermodynamic model we provide a quantitative description for the observed surface-induced selection of one isomeric form.</p>

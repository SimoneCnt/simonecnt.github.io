Molecular self-assembly at surfaces is a prominent example of self-organization
of matter with outstanding technological applications. The ability to predict
the structure of the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) formed at equilibrium is of
great fundamental and technological importance. During this project I developed
a self-consistent theory for a first-principle interpretation of 2D
self-assembly based on modeling and statistical thermodynamics. 

The framework provides access to the thermodynamic stability of the SAM and to
its concentration and temperature dependence. This allows to study competitive
equilibria at surfaces and to rationalize the 2D polymorphism as evidenced by
scanning probe techniques.

I worked on this project during my PhD at the University of Strasbourg under
the supervision of Dr. Marco Cecchini
([ifmlab](http://ifmlab.u-strasbg.fr){:target="_blank"}).

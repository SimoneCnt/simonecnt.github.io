### Welding electrodes

Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW), also known as Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG)
welding, is an arc welding process. The electrodes used for this are, as the
name suggests, made of tungsten, both pure or as an alloy with other metals.
Same of these contain thorium in the form thorium oxide (thoria,
ThO<sub>2</sub>).  Three thoriated alloys have been standardized: WT20 (red
tip) contains about 2% of thoria, WT30 (violet tip) contains 3%, and WT40
(orange tip) contains 4%.

In the figure, 10 red tip (2% thoria) electrodes with a diameter of 1.6 mm and
a length of 15 cm.  Assuming a density for this alloy of about 19
g/cm<sup>3</sup>, each electrode weights about 5.75 g, of which 0.11 g are of
thoria. Thoria contains about 88% or thorium, so each electrode contains about
0.1 g of thorium.  Summing the content of the 10 electrodes, they should
contain a total of about 1 g of thorium.  This makes calculations for the
theoretical activity easy, as the specific activity of Th-232 is 5 kBq/g. This
is valid only if the thorium is "new"; a 10-fold increase in activity in
expected during the first 50 years of aging. As of May 2018, the SGS-5 geiger
counter measures 118 CPM (background already subtracted), or 0.69 &mu;Sv/h.

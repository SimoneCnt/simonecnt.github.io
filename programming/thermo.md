Thermo
=====
---

Thermo is a software that calculates an estimation of the thermodynamics 
quantities of a molecular system based on closed-form expressions derived from 
a statistical mechanics approach. This involves the calculation of energy, 
entropy and free energy of molecules from their molecular properties like the 
mass, the moments of inertia, or the vibrational frequencies.

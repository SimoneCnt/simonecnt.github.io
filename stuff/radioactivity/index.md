In these pages I am collecting some material about radioactivity processes and
on radioactive samples you can find around you. We are surrounded by radioactive
materials, so it is good to know at least a bit about it.

This is a work in progress, and the following pages have to be considered just
drafts. 

 - [Atoms & Nuclides](/stuff/radioactivity/nuclides/)  
    A brief introduction on what are atoms, isotopes and nuclides just to set
    some terminology...
 - [Types of radioactive decay](/stuff/radioactivity/types/)  
    Description of the main processes which cause radioactivity.
 - [Units of measure](/stuff/radioactivity/units/)  
    Radioactivity is a physical phenomenon, and, as such, we can observe it and 
    measure it!
 - [Radioactive Samples](/stuff/radioactivity/samples/)  
    A small collection of radioactive materials you can find around you -- or 
    that you can easily buy.

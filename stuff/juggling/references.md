## Physics of Juggling

[//]: # (Beek_ScienceOfJuggling.pdf)

*Peter J. Beek and Arthur Lewbel,* [The science of juggling](https://www2.bc.edu/arthur-lewbel/jugweb/sciamjug.pdf)  
Divulgative paper published on Scientific American in 1995 about scientific aspects of juggling.
It has a small part about siteswap.

[//]: # (Shannon_ScientificAspectsJuggling.pdf)

*Claude E. Shannon,* Scientific Aspects of Juggling (in Shannon Collected Papers)  
Very nice paper about the physics of juggling. It introduces the famous "Shannon
Theorem" (the mathematical part is just a couple of pages over fifteen).

[//]: # (Buhler_FontainsShowersCascades.pdf)

*Joe Buhler and Ron Graham,* [Fountains, Showers, and Cascades](https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/j.2326-1951.1984.tb02681.x)  
Clear article discussing Shannon theorem and time of flight.

[//]: # (Tiemann_PhysicsJuggling.pdf)

*Bengt Magnusson, and Bruce Tieman,* [The physics of juggling](https://aapt.scitation.org/doi/10.1119/1.2342885)  
Article published on "The physics theacher" in 1989. The focus is on the relations between throw height, number of balls and timing.
Nice discussion also about clubs rotation and orientation.


## Siteswap

[//]: # (//)

[www.siteswap.org](http://www.siteswap.org/)  
First reference for siteswap articles and links.

[//]: # (Knutson_SiteswapFAQ.pdf)

*Allen Knutson,* [Siteswap FAQ](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~cranston/juggling/siteswap_faq.html)  
Nice first introduction to siteswap written in 1993. Starts with vanilla siteswap, introduces 
juggling states and presents syncronous and multiplexing notation. Have some nice examples to try.

[//]: # (Beevers_GuideToJugglingPatterns.pdf)

*Benjamin Beever,* [Guide to Juggling Patterns](https://www.jugglingedge.com/pdf/BenBeeversGuidetoJugglingPatterns.pdf)  
Short book of 67 pages about siteswap notation. Can download for free from the 
link above.

[//]: # (Polster_MathematicsOfJuggling.pdf)

*Burkard Polster,* [The Mathematics of Juggling](https://www.qedcat.com/articles/juggling_survey.pdf)  
Introduction to siteswap and juggling states, with a focus on the mathematics.
Interesting is the mathematical style, with enunciation of ''Juggling Theorems''.
Written as a presentation, not a scientific paper.

[//]: # (Polster_JugglingMath.pdf)

*Burkard Polster,* [Juggling, maths and a beautiful mind](https://plus.maths.org/content/juggling-maths-and-beautiful-mind)  
A shorter version of the paper above.

[//]: # (Hall_SiteswapList_p.odt)

*Matt Hall,* [Siteswap list](http://jugglesensei.net/SiteswapFun1.htm)  
A very long list of siteswap patterns. Both vanilla, syncrhonous and multiplexing.

[//]: # (Vanwynsberghe_Addicted.pdf)

*Hans Vanwynsberghe,* [Addicted to Ball and Club Juggling](http://www.jonglage.net/theorie/notation/siteswap-avancee/refs/books/Hans%20Vanwynsberghe%20-%20Addicted%20to%20Ball%20and%20Club%20Juggling.pdf)  
To check - A lot of juggling tricks!

## Hard Mathematics

[//]: # (Boyce_LongestPrime.pdf)

*Jack Boyce,* [The Longest Prime Siteswap Patterns](http://www.jonglage.net/theorie/notation/siteswap-avancee/refs/Jack%20Boyce%20-%20The%20Longest%20Prime%20Siteswap%20Patterns.pdf)  
Discussion in simple terms about prime patterns, in particular how to find the 
longest prime patterns. The focus is not juggling, but the language is understandable.

[//]: # (Polster_MathematicsJugglingBook.pdf)

*Burkard Polster,* [The Mathematics of Juggling](https://www.springer.com/la/book/9780387955131)  
Full-size book. Didn't check it yet, but looks like it is focused on the math.
(You can find free pdf online if you look hard enough...)

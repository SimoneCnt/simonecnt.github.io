### #236 - Blue fluorescent amber from Sumatra, Indonesia

**Locality:** Sumatra, Indonesia  
**Size:** 7 pieces  
**Weight:** 53g  

Amber pieces from Sumatra, Indonesia. Brown in visible light, strong pastel
blue fluorescence under longwave UV light. Always blue but dimmer in under
shortwave, with few green speckles.  Amber from Indonesia is relatively young
for an amber, so it may be better classified as a very old copal.
